    <p> Indochina, Capa jumps Jeep <br>
        Two feet creep up the road <br>
        To photo, to record, meat lumps and war<br>
        They advance as does his chance, ohh<br>
        Very yellow-white flash<br>
        A violent wrench grips mass<br>
        Rips light, tears limbs like rags<br>
        Burst so high, finally Capa lands<br>
        Mine is a watery pit<br>
        Painless with immense distance<br>
        From medic, from colleague, friend, enemy, foe<br>
        Him five yards from his leg<br>
        From you Taro, oh<br>
        Do not spray into eyes<br>
        I have sprayed you into my eyes<br>
        3:10 p.m.<br>
        Capa pends death, quivers, last rattles, last chokes<br>
        All colours and cares glaze to grey<br>
        Shriveled and stricken to dots<br>
        The left hand grasps what the body grasps not, ohh<br>
        Le photographe est mort<br>
        3.1415, alive no longer my amour<br>
        Faded for home May of '54<br>
        Doors open like arms, my love<br>
        Painless with a great closeness<br>
        To Capa, to Capa Capa dark after nothing<br>
        Re-united with his leg<br>
        And with you, Taro, oh<br>
        Taro, ohh<br>
        Do not spray into eyes<br>
        I have sprayed you into my eyes<br>
        Hey, Taro!</p>
